He was already a known name in plenty of circles, but Majors’ casting in the MCU as Kang the Conqueror, its next major villain — as well as his appearance in Creed III — rocketed Majors to superstardom, only for the actor to quickly tank.</p><p data-characters=691 data-current-count=1008 data-injectable=true>Accusations of assault and a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">history of violence</a> have been pouring in for more than a month now, leaving Majors’ future in the MCU unclear. While none of the accusations have been proven just yet, more people have reportedly come forward with further allegations of abuse, and most people predict Majors’ time in the massive franchise is at an end. That creates a wealth of issues for Marvel to traverse, and has kept the 33-year-old actor’s name in the headlines for weeks on end. As people continue to digest still-emerging details about the actor, they’re finding themselves with questions about everything from his past and future projects to his age and height.</p><h2 id=h-how-tall-is-the-mcu-s-jonathan-majors data-injectable=false>How tall is the MCU’s Jonathan Majors?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kang_Scott_height.jpg><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>In his appearances as Kang and Damian “Diamond Dame” Anderson, Majors looks to be pretty tall. He’s an inherently imposing figure as Kang the Conqueror, of course, and he entered the franchise in a role that largely saw him stay seated. He rarely stood up during Loki‘s run, which left many viewers to see him at his full height for the first time in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Majors stands at an impressive, but not daunting, 6 feet tall. His height is reported with a few variations by sites like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sportskeeda</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CelebHeights</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, and all agree that he is between 5 foot 11 inches and a full 6 feet tall. He’s even said as much in the past, placing his height at 6 feet exactly, and this is more than enough confirmation for most people.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=false>He certainly seems to have a few inches on fellow Quantumania star Paul Rudd, who is clearly shorter than Majors in shots of the pair together. Stills of their characters from the third Ant-Man film seemingly confirm that Majors stands right around the 6 foot mark, maybe even a bit taller if broad reports that Rudd is 5’11” are to be believed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMrZilpF2ewG62zqeYraCRo3qurcmoqaxn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brittany-kerr-net-worth-age-wiki-biography-relationship-wife-dating-ethnicity-height-facts-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brittany Kerr Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Biography, Relationship, Wife, Dating, Ethnicity,Height&amp;amp;Fa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./spoiler-alert-we-may-already-know-who-wins-season-2-of-the-challenge-usa.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Spoiler alert: We may already know who wins season 2 of The Challenge: USA</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-wash-nike-slides.html>How to wash nike slides</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rowan-atkinson-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88717-html.html>Rowan Atkinson Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./smutty-streaming-users-have-some-explaining-to-do-after-a-softcore-porno-unzips-a-new-lease-of-life.html>Smutty streaming users have some explaining to do after a softcore porno unzips a new lease of life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./6-films-prove-keanu-reeves-comedy.html>6 Films That Prove Keanu Reeves Should Do More Comedy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsey-lamb.html>Kelsey Lamb</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe.
