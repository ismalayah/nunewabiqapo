At one point, they reportedly crashed Kyle Kennedy's wedding, drawing ire from her mom, Victoria Gifford Kennedy. Conor apparently failed to RSVP to the event but still decided to attend with a date in tow — Swift, who was already a superstar in her own right at the time.</p><p>"[Swift and Conor] texted me an hour before the wedding and asked if they could come. I responded with a very clear 'Please do not come.' They came anyway," Victoria told the <a href=#>Boston Herald</a>. "I personally went up to Ms. Swift, whose entrance distracted the entire event, politely introduced myself to her and asked her as nicely as I could to leave. It was like talking to a ghost. She seemed to look right past me." Swift's team squashed her statement right away, saying that the singer was welcome all along. "Taylor was invited to the wedding and the bride thanked her profusely for being there," her rep said.</p><p>But amid all the drama, it seems that the rest of the Kennedys are chummy with the country crooner. Rory Kennedy told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that Swift was a "great friend of all of ours" and that she's "awesome and we love her," while Ethel Kennedy even hinted at having her officially join the family someday. "We should be so lucky!" Conor's very own grandmother said. Former U.S. Representative Patrick Kennedy echoed the same sentiment, telling <a href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;he was thrilled that Conor was dating Swift.&nbsp;"We love Taylor Swift. ...&nbsp;If she wants to be in the family, she's already a part of it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxgbn95fo6hprBlk6S7sL6MpJynppWZxm6ywKagpbFdm7KtwIytmLKkn6d6tMPIn6tmqp%2Birq%2BvxGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bryson-barnes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bryson Barnes Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Wife, Salary, Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gilberto-gless-age-how-old-is-he-family-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gilberto Gless Age: How Old Is He?
