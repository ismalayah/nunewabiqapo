Judging solely from the lineup of talking heads assembled here—a murderer's row that includes <a href=#>Larry David</a>, <a href=#>Whoopi Goldberg</a>, <a href=#>Amy Schumer</a>, <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon</a>, <a href=#>Martin Short</a>, <a href=#>Christopher Guest</a>, <a href=#>Janeane Garofalo</a>, <a href=#>Kumail Nanjiani</a>, <a href=#>Jason Alexander</a> and forty other boldfaced names—he's a man who commands an extraordinary degree of trust, and this is confirmed when you hear the subjects open up to his skillful questions.<br></p><p>Freddie Prinze, Jr., for one, talks about how he was more or less ordered into standup comedy by his grandfather after his troubled dad, star of TV's "Chico and the Man," committed suicide, in order to "fix what your father fucked up." Nearly every other comedian who's included in the "origins" portion of the documentary shares some version of a tragic, or at least uncomfortable, backstory, as well as a feeling of emptiness that could only be filled by hearing the laughter of strangers. Comedy as catharsis and a means of public sharing also gets a segment; the emotional peak is <a href=#>Maria Bamford</a> talking about the first time she used her stint in a mental hospital as fuel for a routine, and heard audience members shouting out their own traumas in response. We also hear secondhand stories about Lenny Bruce, <a href=#>Richard Pryor</a>, <a href=#>George Carlin</a>, Sam Kinison and other standup legends whose demons fueled their art and set fire to the personal lives.<br></p><p>The problem, unfortunately, is that Pollak's film isn't content to zero in on the assertion promised by the title: "Misery Loves Comedy." That phrase clearly holds true for the people interviewed here: to some degree, they're all people whose unhappiness drove them to make people laugh, then perhaps try to steer that laughter towards shared introspection. ("What kind of clown are you?" somebody asks Bill Murray's Bozo-garbed bank robber in "<a href=#>Quick Change</a>," to which he replies, "The crying on the inside kind, I guess.") But that's not the focus. In fact it's often difficult to say what the film's focus actually is; a more accurate title might've been "Bits and Pieces of Interviews with 50 Comedians," but that wouldn't fit on most marquees.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46moKydoq56rbvVnqpmm5%2BisqXFjGtnam0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./5-letter-words-ending-in-nt-wordle-game-help.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>5 letter words ending in NT Wordle Game Help</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./many-outlets-on-the-internet-assume-that-awonuga-is-the-mother-of-zlatan-ibiles-child.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Many Outlets On The Internet Assume That Awonuga Is The Mother Of Zlatan Ibiles Child</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-wash-nike-slides.html>How to wash nike slides</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rowan-atkinson-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88717-html.html>Rowan Atkinson Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./smutty-streaming-users-have-some-explaining-to-do-after-a-softcore-porno-unzips-a-new-lease-of-life.html>Smutty streaming users have some explaining to do after a softcore porno unzips a new lease of life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./6-films-prove-keanu-reeves-comedy.html>6 Films That Prove Keanu Reeves Should Do More Comedy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsey-lamb.html>Kelsey Lamb</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe.
