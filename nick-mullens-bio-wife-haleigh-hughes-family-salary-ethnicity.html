Even though he enjoyed a record-breaking career in college, Mullens went undrafted in the 2017 NFL Draft. He bounced from the practice squad to eventually make his way into the San Francisco 49ers’ first team. Mullens finally got his chance to shine in November 2018 and he delivered an unforgettable debut. Want to know more about this player with the never-say-die attitude? We have all the details right here.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bio-age-and-ethnicity></span><strong>Bio (Age and Ethnicity)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nicholas Clayton Mullens was born on the 21st of March 1995 in Little Rock, Arkansas. His nationality is American while his ethnicity is Caucasian. Mullens spent his formative years in Hoover, Alabama and attended Spain Park High School. In high school, he was a multi-sport athlete and participated in American football and baseball. He, however, shone best on the football field; recording an exceptional 3,649 yards, 40 touchdowns and 7 interceptions in his senior year alone. These achievements fetched him several honours including Gatorade 2012 Alabama Football Player of the Year.</p><p>Thanks to his high school exploits, Nick Mullens received offers from several colleges and chose the University of Southern Mississippi. At Southern Miss, he majored in Marketing and played football for the school’s Golden Eagles team. The Alabama-native completed 546 of 928 passes for 11,994 yards, 87 touchdowns and 46 interceptions in his four years in college. The above-mentioned stats surpassed every other previously-held record in the school, including those set by NFL great, Brett Favre.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nfl-career></span><strong>NFL Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nick Mullens went undrafted in the 2017 NFL Draft and subsequently joined the practice squad of the San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers already had three reliable quarterbacks and the Alabama native had to settle with being their 4th string quarterback. He, however, did not allow this fact to discourage him but worked hard even when he had no hopes of playing. Fortune smiled on Nick Mullens in November 2018 when the other quarterbacks suffered various injuries. He was thus named the starting quarterback for the 49ers week nine game against the Oakland Raiders. Mullens made his NFL debut on the 1st of November 2018 and gave an unforgettable performance. He completed 22 passes for 262 yards, with three touchdowns and zero interceptions, leading his team to a 34-3 victory. His amazing debut fetched him a congratulatory phone call from Brett Favre himself. His Twitter account also received the precious blue tick confirmation mark even before the game was over!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=salary></span><strong>Salary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nick Mullens signed a two-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers in September 2018. The contract is worth a non-guaranteed sum of $1.05 million. Mullens’ salary for 2018 is estimated at $395,294 while his salary for 2019 is significantly higher at $570,000. There is no doubt that if the Alabama-native continues with his impressive form, he will definitely be rewarded with fatter paychecks and juicier contracts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-wife-%e2%80%93-haleigh-hughes></span><strong>Family, Wife – Haleigh Hughes</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nick Mullens hails from a family of five. His father’s name is Mark while his mother’s name is Suzanne. The quarterback also has an elder sister named Heather and an elder brother named Frank. It must be noted that Mullens is not the first professional athlete in his family’s history. His maternal grandfather, Ernie Tabor and his maternal uncle, Scott, were both professional baseball players.</p><p>The quarterback is enjoying marital bliss with his wife, Haleigh Hughes – a native of Mississippi, born on the 24th of March 1994. Her parents’ names are Kiley and Kellie Hughes and she has two brothers, one of whom is named Layton. Hughes obtained her diploma from Ocean Springs High School before moving to the University of Southern Mississippi for her college degree. During her college days, she was a well-rounded student as she not only maintained a healthy GP but also excelled in cheerleading. She graduated in 2016 and has since made a career as an elementary school teacher.</p><p>Mullens first met his wife when they were both students at Southern Miss. They commenced their relationship in 2015 and tied the knot two years later in July 2017. The couple now resides in California following Mullens’ contract with the 49ers. Hughes has been highly supportive of her husband’s career and often participates in events organized by his team. Following his magnificent debut, she posted a tribute to him on Instagram in which she described him as an incredible human with a pure heart and soul. With regards to children, Mullens and his wife do not have any kids yet but they do have a beloved dog named Scout.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKaZmLhuudSlo56mo2KvqruMsKCfnV2drq2xyKCfZqClnLWmv4yfmKahnK56tK3LmqmyZZWpta%2B1wqKrsmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-considine-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-244378-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tim Considine Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-abbott-jr.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Abbott Jr. movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-wash-nike-slides.html>How to wash nike slides</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rowan-atkinson-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88717-html.html>Rowan Atkinson Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./smutty-streaming-users-have-some-explaining-to-do-after-a-softcore-porno-unzips-a-new-lease-of-life.html>Smutty streaming users have some explaining to do after a softcore porno unzips a new lease of life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./6-films-prove-keanu-reeves-comedy.html>6 Films That Prove Keanu Reeves Should Do More Comedy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsey-lamb.html>Kelsey Lamb</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe.
