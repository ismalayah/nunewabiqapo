One of the show’s stars, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dani</a></strong>, lives with her aunt and uncle, and alludes to a difficult situation with her birth parents. There’s a reason for that, which we’ll thoroughly explore here.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>While on the surface it may seem like a gimmick show, at its core it’s a show about love and humanity, and what it means to search for those things in the modern age. Since its premiere on in May of 2022, the show’s become a phenomenon of sorts.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>The latest season is no different. It premiered on Jan. 19, and its one of those shows that people just know about. It also made the cast fairly famous, with many of them harboring massive followings on social media.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false>Before we dig into the Dani question, let’s explore some background.</p><h2 id=h-why-is-love-on-the-spectrum-so-popular data-injectable=false>Why is Love on the Spectrum so popular?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>Far from being a downer, the show is uplifting and often hilarious. It originally hails from Australia, where a show with the exact same format ran from 2019 to 2021. Netflix picked up the show exclusively after that, and subscribers to the streamer have been reaping the benefits of that deal ever since.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>The idea for Love on the Spectrum comes from Cian O’Clery, who appears off camera frequently as he communicates with the cast. O’Clery <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">got the idea</a> for the show after his time on another, similar show, called Employable Me. That show spotlights people living with various disabilities as they try to navigate the workforce.</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>Love on the Spectrum is filmed a certain way, and that has a lot to do with its popularity. It’s very hands-off and shot in a distant documentary style, where you feel like you’re really just watching life unfold.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>There’s no “set” level of autism, either. Every participant is at different places on the spectrum, with some symptoms and behaviours more apparent in certain people than others. Part of its charm lies in focusing on people you don’t necessarily see on TV on a regular basis.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>Every character is unique in their own way, and this adds a lot of variety to the proceedings, and the show gives every character space to really be themselves. There’s also the added tension of each person going on a date: Getting ready, being nervous, wanting things to go well, etc. These are all very human, relatable behaviors that really make the show a gem to watch.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>It’s a show that gives us some escapism, but it also has an uplifting bent based on how much these people really just want love and all it has to offer. It’s hard not to root for that! There’s also the returning faces from season one. Abbey and David are back, and we get to see them go from first date to a trip to Africa full of lions and adventure.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>Also back: Dani, who wants love but also has very specific wants when it comes to a partner. One of those wants includes someone who’s into animation and cartoons. Watching her navigate that is fairly eye-opening and reflective, and it’s made Dani very popular.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why doesn’t Dani live with her parents?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>One thing that’s clear but not really explored too deeply, besides some slight exposition, is Dani’s living situation. She loves with her aunt and uncle, Sandra and Patrick, and alludes to some issues with her birth parents.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>In the first episode of the second season, she goes on a blind date with potential match Matt. The date seems to go about as well it can, and in the lead-up to the date we get a little more information about her past. Before the date, she reveals: “I used to live with my parents, um, but it didn’t last that long. It’s a sad story.”</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>Dani’s real parents are named Myrna Vielma and Robert Bowman. The two <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly divorced</a> in 2010. Dani doesn’t seem to have a relationship with her father, but she does sometimes post pictures of herself hanging out with her mother on Facebook.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image_5ac723.png><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Before the show aired, Dani <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a little bit</a> about her father, and shared an article called Autism’s Lost Generation.</p><p>“I really wish my own father would have gotten a diagnosis, but he is now lost among the homeless. I really think and worry about him especially during this time of year. That is why once again this year, I will be out feeding the homeless this Christmas. If only he had gotten help.”</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>We can surmise from this difficult post that Dani’s father is troubled and seemingly homeless. Dani shared more in other posts as well. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one post from 2016</a>, she shared that she wished she could “send a letter back in time” to her parents, when they “first realized I was different.”</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>She tells them to not view her through “her deficits” but through her strengths, and that everything will work out if this personal creed is followed. This will allow them to “stop being scared” and “start to be proud” of her.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>“I can’t imagine the disappointment, and/or the terror that you must of felt when I was first diagnosed or when you first realize I was different,” she said. “I wish I could go back in time and comfort you.”</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>This feels like there was a possibility that her parents couldn’t handle her autism. That doesn’t mean we should feel bad for her, though. Dani has a great life and lots of love and support from her aunt and uncle, something she wouldn’t be able to get from her real parents.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>Dani appeared on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fails, Falls & F-Ups</a> a few years ago to talk about her love of animation and her upbringing, and she credits her aunt and uncle for helping her start her animation company.</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>“Sandy and Patrick noticed it all. They just noticed my gifts. So what they did is that they help me get my company started,” she said.</p><p data-characters=85 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>With support like that, it’s no surprise that Dani has come so far in her life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmm6ido2KxorrIZp2rp51iubDCxGamp2WknbJuv8%2Bemq2qpaJ6rbXVnmSwoaSdeqmx0WaYrqakZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bleak-nyt-crossword-clue-answer-with-6-letters-1268181.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bleak NYT Crossword Clue Answer With 6 letters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./keyon-mozee-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-178240-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Keyon Mozee Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-wash-nike-slides.html>How to wash nike slides</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rowan-atkinson-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88717-html.html>Rowan Atkinson Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./smutty-streaming-users-have-some-explaining-to-do-after-a-softcore-porno-unzips-a-new-lease-of-life.html>Smutty streaming users have some explaining to do after a softcore porno unzips a new lease of life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./6-films-prove-keanu-reeves-comedy.html>6 Films That Prove Keanu Reeves Should Do More Comedy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsey-lamb.html>Kelsey Lamb</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe.
