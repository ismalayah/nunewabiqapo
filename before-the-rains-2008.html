It's directed by <a href=#>Santosh Sivan</a>, originally a cinematographer, whose masterpiece "<a href=#>The Terrorist</a>" (1999) involved a young woman committed to being a suicide bomber. That movie was the most thoughtful and empathetic film I've seen about the mind of a person who arrives at such a decision. "The Terrorist" involves an assassination attempt; this one is set against the tide of Indian nationalism.</p><p>But it's not really a political film. It's driven by lust, guilt and shame of a melodramatic sort that was right at home in the silent era. That doesn't mean it's old-fashioned, but that it's broadly melodramatic. It centers on the lives of a British landowner in India, his Indian right-hand man, and the landowner's affair with his beautiful young servant woman. Both the man and the woman are married, so there are problems in addition to the taboo against mixing the races and classes.</p><p>The man is Henry Moores (<a href=#>Linus Roache</a>), who lives in a big, comfortable house with his wife, Laura (<a href=#>Jennifer Ehle</a>), and young son, Peter (<a href=#>Leo Benedict</a>). Next door lives his assistant, T.K. (<a href=#>Rahul Bose</a>), who has abandoned his roots in the nearby village and cast his lot with the Brits. They run a tea plantation and discover cinnamon higher in the hills. That involves the construction of a road up a steep hillside, which must zigzag its way to the top to avoid being washed away in the monsoons.</p><p>Laura and Peter are away at the beginning of the film, and Henry and his servant Sajani (<a href=#>Nandita Das</a>) seek honey for their tea in a "sacred grove." They're seen by two talkative young boys, and that leads, as it must, to tragedy. Laura and Peter return. Sajani is beaten by her husband, who has learned of her secret tryst (but not the identity of her partner). And that sets into motion a series of events involving who she can trust, who she can believe and where she can turn.</p><p>This paragraph is a spoiler: Henry gives T.K. all the money he has on hand and asks him to send Sajani "away." T.K. reports, "I put her in a boat -- for the north." But India is a big country and the north is a distant destination for a woman in a small boat with one oarsman. Sajani, covered in blood, returns in the middle of the night to T.K.'s house, where Henry meets her. He's desperate. The village has reported her "missing," his wife is having suspicions, and when Sajani asks him "Do you really love me?" he replies "No." I think he says that for her own good. But she takes a handy pistol and kills herself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bnJ%2Bnopp6tbTEZqmaoZ6oenN8j3E%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./near-age-death-note.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Old Is Near In Death Note?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brielle-barbusca.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brielle Barbusca- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-wash-nike-slides.html>How to wash nike slides</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rowan-atkinson-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88717-html.html>Rowan Atkinson Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./smutty-streaming-users-have-some-explaining-to-do-after-a-softcore-porno-unzips-a-new-lease-of-life.html>Smutty streaming users have some explaining to do after a softcore porno unzips a new lease of life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./6-films-prove-keanu-reeves-comedy.html>6 Films That Prove Keanu Reeves Should Do More Comedy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsey-lamb.html>Kelsey Lamb</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe.
