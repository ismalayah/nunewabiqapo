A full 11 American series were born of that single concept, along with a whopping 21 international iterations. These days, the show — which follows a group of affluent women as they live their lives, stir up drama, and talk endless smack — has a foothold in nearly every region of the States, and its spin-off series’ are nearly as popular. On top of the 32 separate Real Housewives series, 27 spin-off series, including Vanderpump Rules, were inspired by the specific brand of drama the franchise makes its bread and butter.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>That branded drama is rearing its head in the current season of The Real Housewives of New York City, which is presently airing its 14th season. The season marks the first full reboot of a RHONY cast in the history of the show, with each member of the former cast replaced with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">brand new Housewife</a>. Fans are still <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">getting to know the Housewives</a> as a result, and they recently got their introduction to Erin Lichy’s husband, Abraham Lichy.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-erin-s-husband-abraham-lichy data-injectable=false>Who is Erin’s husband, Abraham Lichy?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Erin Dana Lichy (@erindanalichy)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>The husbands rarely play a major role in the Real Housewives‘ primary story, but occasionally they become a vital part of the show’s formula. Take The Real Housewives of New Jersey‘s latest season, which saw drama erupt around cast member Teresa Giudice’s husband, Luis Ruelas, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the couple’s feud</a> with fellow cast members Melissa and Joe Gorga. RHONJ has made the husbands a part of its formula, and it seems to be working for audiences.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>The same has yet to occur on RHONY, but the series might be on its way. Despite largely avoiding the topic of their husbands through the majority of the show, Erin recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned her home life</a> and invited one of the Housewives to hers for an anniversary party.</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>The mention of Erin’s life away from the camera instantly sparked interest and led to a wave of questions from fans. They’re endlessly curious about her husband, Abraham Lichy, and the children the couple share. Not much is known about Erin’s little ones — though her Instagram indicates she has three — but her husband is a different matter. As the owner and founder of Lichy Law, the other half of the Lichy family has earned plenty of fame in his own right.</p><p data-characters=613 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>A lawyer with a surprising background in DJing and fashion, Lichy rang in 40 as a broadly successful businessman. The ‘about’ page <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on his business site</a> describes him as a “born-and-bred New Yorker who has a passion for advising early-stage start-ups and growth-oriented people.” He pursued his education at both the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a lengthy career in law — which includes work at the illustrious Kasowitz Benson Torres — still isn’t enough to distract him from his home life — or his passionate pursuit of DJing.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>With interest in Lichy peaking among RHONY fans, his incorporation into the show may be inevitable. With a brand new cast to get to know, there’s plenty of room for the husbands to get some love, and it seems Lichy is first in line.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S%2FqbvNsmSwoJ9itrR5wJupmqCRonqttcKhsGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./defenders-of-democracy-calls-for-transparency-in-funding-of-alia-care-programme-in-benue.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Defenders of Democracy Calls for Transparency in Funding of Alia Care Programme in Benue</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mesrine-killer-instinct-2010.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mesrine: Killer Instinct movie review (2010)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-wash-nike-slides.html>How to wash nike slides</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rowan-atkinson-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88717-html.html>Rowan Atkinson Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./smutty-streaming-users-have-some-explaining-to-do-after-a-softcore-porno-unzips-a-new-lease-of-life.html>Smutty streaming users have some explaining to do after a softcore porno unzips a new lease of life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./6-films-prove-keanu-reeves-comedy.html>6 Films That Prove Keanu Reeves Should Do More Comedy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsey-lamb.html>Kelsey Lamb</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe.
