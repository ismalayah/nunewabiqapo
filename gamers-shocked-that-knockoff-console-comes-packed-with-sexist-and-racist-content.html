Some parents are discovering just that after buying a <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Nintendo</a></strong> knockoff called the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Mini SN-02</a></strong>!</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=553 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>Parents have to look closely at the kinds of toys they are getting their kids these days. Some parents bought the Super Mini SN-02 thinking it was the Super Nintendo. They look exactly the same. It has very similar packaging, and when it is taken out of the box, it looks just like the original game console. When it‚Äôs turned on, at first, it looks like the games kids played back in the ‚Äô90s with a Mario-looking race game and a Mike Tyson-looking boxing match. Plus, a $50 console sounds a lot better to a parent‚Äôs wallet than $150.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Why wouldn‚Äôt a parent want that for their children who is just learning gaming and hasn‚Äôt had a chance to step up to the big leagues yet? Anyone would, but it‚Äôs a worse deal than it seems. Parents are speaking out and making sure others know to be very aware of what they are buying their kids.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>Who needs a naked Mowgli running around a Jungle Bookish forest? Who needs to know the email account of the programmer while playing a game with a sexually explicit Ronald McDonald lookalike? The answer is no one.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>Nintendo is not associated with Super Mini SN-02 in any way. Amazon and Walmart aren‚Äôt associated with the company either, even though they are being sold on both of those websites. However, Amazon and Walmart have a similar seller arrangement where any merchant can sell their merchandise on those sites as long as they follow the very strict seller‚Äôs policies.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>While Super Mini SN-02 does not follow the seller‚Äôs policies on either one of those sites, removing the product is like cutting one head off of a three-headed dragon. Three more pop up in its place as soon as the first one is taken down. The best bet is to make sure the product is the original and stop buying knockoff products.</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>A parent might have to spend more money, but it‚Äôs way better than having to find out the hard way with a company that has a no-return policy.</p><h2 id=h-for-your-information data-injectable=false>For Your Information</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who owns the rights to the Super mini SN-02 cause you mf got some explaining to do about game #54 BlackMan2 wtf!</p>‚Äî ApostleSaucem (@GotBurlz) <a href=#>January 22, 2021</a><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>Also, this is good to know.

Yeah it had some good games but 2 games on it had nudity. One was a Mario like game and he was completely nude the other one was an game rom hack of a old NES game called McKids. But the title read as Dick Kids and the 2 kid characters you play as are completely nude. Hence the reason I returned it and giving it a bad review.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=61 data-injectable=false>WGTC has reached out to one of the manufacturers for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZonpqllafAbr%2FHqJqknZRiwamt02aip6eToLynsoycpqern6Gybq%2FOppysZaCWsKyxw2auoqyYYsCmxMisq2aZnpl6s63CoqqtZZOku7Wxza1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sygna-suit-steven-deoxys-debuts-in-pokemon-masters-ex-alongside-a-fire-and-ground-type-egg-event-and-other-recurring-rallies-and-events-294039.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sygna Suit Steven &amp;amp; Deoxys debuts in Pokmon Masters EX, alongside a Fire- and Ground-Type Egg Even</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./katie-kreisler.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Katie Kreisler movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-wash-nike-slides.html>How to wash nike slides</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rowan-atkinson-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88717-html.html>Rowan Atkinson Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./smutty-streaming-users-have-some-explaining-to-do-after-a-softcore-porno-unzips-a-new-lease-of-life.html>Smutty streaming users have some explaining to do after a softcore porno unzips a new lease of life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./6-films-prove-keanu-reeves-comedy.html>6 Films That Prove Keanu Reeves Should Do More Comedy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsey-lamb.html>Kelsey Lamb</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe.
