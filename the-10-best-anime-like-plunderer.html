Moreover, there’s some really dark moments that elevate the plot significantly. The only problem is that while it’s an entertaining watch, you’re not spoiled with the amount of episodes to binge through. There’s only 24 episodes available, which means you’re probably going to watch something after you’re done with Hina and the others that call Alcia home. So when you’re all done, keep the fantasy alive with these similar stories!</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-10-trigun data-injectable=false>10.
