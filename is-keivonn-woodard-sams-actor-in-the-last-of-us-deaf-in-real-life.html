While the HBO series <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of U</a></strong><a href=#>s</a> may be his first acting gig, the nine-year-old became a local celebrity in Bowie, Maryland, after earning a spot on the local hockey team. It’s not just his status as a Black hockey player (according to the NHL only 3% of players are non-white) that makes Woodard stand apart from the crowd. Woodard is part of a six-generation deaf family, many of whom are actors. It’s a difficult career choice for many; Woodard’s mother, April Jackson-Woodard, was an actress herself. “I had a major in acting, and I really hit a lot of barriers being deaf,” she said in an interview with the local station, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WUSA9</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=589 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>Keivonn is breaking the barriers that stopped his mother’s career. While he was surprised to have been cast in The Last of Us, those who know him were less shocked. His team has been referring to him as ‘Hollywood’ since he shared the news. While his mother feels a little overwhelmed, Keivonn is fully prepared for a life in the spotlight. His aspirations are to continue his hockey career and become the first Black deaf player. His hockey coach, Chris Pozerski, thinks he can go all the way: “His talent, you know, for a kid his age is something that as a coach is fantastic.”</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>With pressure on after several phenomenal episodes, and the emotional weight of Sam and Henry’s story arc to bare, Keivonn has some huge shoes to fill. But according to his mother, the young actor is prepared: “He really has the passion to drive him to say ‘I can do it.’ So I’m inspired.” If the first four episodes of The Last of Us are any indication, Keivonn is set to inspire us all.</p><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=139 data-injectable=false>Woodard will play Sam in the upcoming fifth episode of HBO’s The Last of Us, which will be airing on Feb. 10 at 6PM/PT and 9PM/ET on HBO.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnKnqCvp56jeri7zp2Yq5xdqK6uv4yamq2nomK2r3nToZxmpJGowW67xWasrGWUmq6necinZKudkaF6rbXFnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-truth-about-janet-jackson-and-jermaine-dupris-complicated-relationship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Truth About Janet Jackson And Jermaine Dupri's Complicated Relationship</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-old-was-granny-on-the-beverly-hillbillies-and-who-played-her.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How old was Granny on the Beverly Hillbillies and who played her?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-wash-nike-slides.html>How to wash nike slides</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rowan-atkinson-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88717-html.html>Rowan Atkinson Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./smutty-streaming-users-have-some-explaining-to-do-after-a-softcore-porno-unzips-a-new-lease-of-life.html>Smutty streaming users have some explaining to do after a softcore porno unzips a new lease of life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./6-films-prove-keanu-reeves-comedy.html>6 Films That Prove Keanu Reeves Should Do More Comedy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsey-lamb.html>Kelsey Lamb</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe.
