Earlier this year, Lowe starred in a Netflix film titled Dog Gone, which was an adaptation of a Marley and Me-esque novel based on the true story of a community effort of finding a lost dog.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>Just recently, Lowe’s latest project arrived by way of sitcom series <a href=#>Unstable</a>, in which he plays a biotech genius named Ellis, who brings his son into the family business, as the pair come to grips with the passing of Ellis’ wife.</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>The resemblance between Rob Lowe and his co-star who plays his son is remarkably uncanny, and there’s a good reason for that. It turns out that Ellis’ son, Jackson, is played by his real-life son. While this isn’t the first time that the father and son duo have appeared on screen together, it is certainly their first co-starring appearance, which is probably pretty special for the both of them.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>While we have a pretty good understanding of who Rob Lowe is with his extensive career and acting resume, we may not be as familiar with his son – so here’s everything you need to know.</p><h2 id=h-who-plays-rob-lowe-s-son-in-unstable data-injectable=false>Who plays Rob Lowe’s son in Unstable?&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/john-owen-lowe.png><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Rob Lowe’s son and Unstable co-star is John Owen Lowe. Born in 1995, Lowe is around 28 years of age. Much like how Ellis introduces Jackson to the family business in Unstable, Rob Lowe very much passed the torch on to John with getting him a start in Hollywood. Per his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb profile</a>, John Owen Lowe made his acting debut in 2014 in a short titled A Canine Affair.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>John Owen would then go on to make appearances in two of his father’s other projects, The Grinder and Holiday in the Wind. Lowe’s son also had a role in Grace Point, which was released in February 2023, before finally starring alongside his father in Unstable.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>John Owen Lowe is also credited as a writer in his and his father’s latest Netflix comedy, and also has a writing credit in 9-1-1: Lone Star. John’s mother is Sheryl Berkoff, to whom Rob Lowe has been married since 1991.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxloqSvbrjOsJysZaOku3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chrystie-jenner-net-worth-age-husband-divorce.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bruce Jenner aka Caitlyn Jenner's Ex-Wife Chrystie Jenner Was Married Twice</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tommy-thayer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-361610-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tommy Thayer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-wash-nike-slides.html>How to wash nike slides</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rowan-atkinson-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88717-html.html>Rowan Atkinson Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./smutty-streaming-users-have-some-explaining-to-do-after-a-softcore-porno-unzips-a-new-lease-of-life.html>Smutty streaming users have some explaining to do after a softcore porno unzips a new lease of life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./6-films-prove-keanu-reeves-comedy.html>6 Films That Prove Keanu Reeves Should Do More Comedy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsey-lamb.html>Kelsey Lamb</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe.
