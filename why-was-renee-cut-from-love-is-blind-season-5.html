After it became clear that Renee and Carter were filmed right up to the altar, fans wanted to know why their story didn’t make the show. Especially with only two other <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">couples making it</a> that far, one would think Netflix had a pretty good reason it decided to cut their scenes. But, nope!</p><h2 id=h-renee-publicly-confirmed-she-got-engaged data-injectable=false>Renee publicly confirmed she got engaged</h2><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>In a new interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">POPSUGAR</a>, Renee finally confirmed that she and Carter got engaged in the pods. She also confirmed that cameras followed them all the way up to the altar, telling the magazine:</p><p>“[Carter and I] did get engaged in the pods, and we were chosen to be followed for the rest of the journey … We were very excited about everything, and things went really well in Mexico as well. We were always very pleasant, funny, happy, and enjoyed each other’s company.”</p><p data-characters=40 data-current-count=40 data-injectable=false>So, did the duo get married?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Renee Poche (@missreneepoche)</a></p></figure><p>“Once we got back to Houston and back to the real world, I started noticing things that I kind of ignored or blew off that were red flags I should have picked up on.

In fact, it sounds like the streamer told her she’d appear far more than she did.</p><p>“I got a call a couple months before the show aired, in August, to let me know that our story wasn’t going to be a big focus. What I was told was, ‘We’ll just, point blank, say that Carter was awful, and we don’t want you to have to relive that. That’s just not going to be a big focus.’ They also said timing was an issue, so they decided to cut our story. That’s what I was told.”</p><p data-characters=37 data-current-count=37 data-injectable=false>Are you confused?

My first question was, ‘Wait, the wedding’s not going to be shown?’ She was like, ‘No, no wedding.’ So I kept asking more, and she was like, ‘I think it’s going to be more like, you guys are friends from the pods.’ It was very vague, and I still thought that possibly we were going to be engaged on the show and then kind of cut down from there.”</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>Imagine her surprise when the show aired, and not only did her engagement get cut, but all of the scenes from Mexico got edited around her and Carter.

Word around the internet is that Carter brought another woman back to their apartment while living together, and threatened producers to unalive himself if they aired his story. Check out the drama unfolding in the comments section of Carter’s last Instagram post!</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>These days, Renee is happily married to someone else who wants nothing to do with her life in the public eye.
