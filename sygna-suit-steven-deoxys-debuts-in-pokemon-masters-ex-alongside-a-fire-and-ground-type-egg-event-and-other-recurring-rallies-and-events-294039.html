Though not yet formally stated in the promotional materials, if this debut follows the same pattern as other sync pairs debuts during this Hoenn Arc, then this new sync pair should have an expanded sync grid, as well as the ability to be raised to 6★ EX, which would increase the pair's stats as well as giving Steven an outfit change based on Deoxys's appearance.</p><p>Sygna Suit Steven & Deoxys are a Psychic-type tech sync pair.
