and</li><li>Chironex yamaguchii – are extremely venomous.</li></ul><p>Since 1883, when records of box jellyfish-related deaths began, these box-shaped, gelatinous carnivores have claimed the lives of hundreds of people.</p><p>In the Philippines alone, approximately 20 individuals die each year due to complications from their stings.</p><p>A box jellyfish typically has a body that’s about eight inches long, and its tentacles can stretch up to 10 feet.</p><p>Most individuals have 15 tentacles on each corner, with each tentacle containing around 500,000 venom injectors.</p><p>To put it simply, a single box jellyfish possesses roughly 30,000,000 venomous stingers!</p><p>Thankfully, the majority of jellyfish stings are mild.</p><p>However, on rare occasions, these creatures unleash their full venomous power, and unfortunate victims can perish within minutes.</p><p>It’s crucial to recognize that jellyfish can be counted among the world’s most venomous animals.</p><h3

<strong>saw-scaled viper, also known as the “carpet viper,</strong>” is the <strong>world’s most venomous snake.</strong></p><p>These deadly snakes belong to the Echis genus and are found in regions across Africa, India, the Middle East, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.</p><p>Encountering one of these snakes is something you should definitely avoid because their bites cause intense pain and are often fatal.</p><p>Echis snakes hold the grim distinction of causing more snakebite-related human deaths worldwide than any other snake genus.</p><p>In their native habitats, these vipers are responsible for more fatalities and result in thousands of amputations.</p><p>Female saw-scaled vipers are twice as venomous as males.</p><p>Their lethal venom contains a mix of neurotoxins, cardiotoxins, hemotoxins, and cytotoxins, which affect the nervous system, heart, blood, and cells, respectively.</p><p>These vipers move through their arid environments using a side-to-side slithering motion.</p><p>They typically measure between one and three feet in length.</p><p>They have brown, gray, or orange skin with dark dorsal patches and pear-shaped heads.</p><h3

red scorpions, known for their small pinchers, bulbous tails, and large stingers, rank as the most venomous scorpions.</p><p>Fatality rates vary from 8 to 40 percent, and tragically, Indian red scorpion venom affects children the most.</p><p><strong>These scorpions inhabit India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka</strong>, typically measuring five to nine centimeters in length and living no longer than five years.</p><p>They thrive in tropical and sub-tropical environments and are frequently captured for research or the illegal pet trade.</p><p>When Indian red scorpions strike humans, the consequences can include vomiting, profuse sweating, convulsions, and even unconsciousness.</p><p>However, not all is bleak regarding their venom.</p><p>Scientists believe that this venom could hold potential for pharmaceutical breakthroughs in combating cancer, malaria, and various skin conditions.</p><h3 id=h-most-venomous-mollusks-cone-snail class=wp-block-heading><span

may seem unassuming, but they hold the title of the world’s most quietly deadly creatures.</p><p>Despite their unimpressive appearance and tendency to be rather inactive, these mollusks possess potent venom.</p><p>There are around 900 different species of cone snails, and their classification has been evolving over the past decade.</p><p>One thing scientists universally agree on is that cone snails rank among the most venomous marine animals on the planet.</p><p>While small cone snails are harmless to humans, the larger ones, which can grow up to almost 10 inches in length, can be perilous.</p><p>Their attacks can lead to challenging symptoms because cone snail stingers function much like hypodermic needles, delivering precise and powerful doses of venom.</p><h3

humans.</p><p>However, they don’t pose a significant threat to people, similar to lizards. Only a few mammals can cause severe harm to humans by injecting venom.</p><p>Male platypuses inject venom from “spurs” on their legs. While this venom is deadly to dogs and cats, it’s not lethal to humans.</p><p>Nonetheless, a platypus bite is painful and can result in temporary incapacitation, along with lasting sensitivity to pain.</p><p>These semi-aquatic, egg-laying mammals are native to eastern Australia and hold great value for modern scientists as a vital link to the distant past in terms of evolution.</p><p>However, the scientific community didn’t always view these duck-billed swimmers favorably.</p><p>When European naturalists first encountered a platypus carcass, they dismissed it as a hoax, believing it had been crafted from various creatures, akin to a Frankenstein creation.</p><p>Therefore, the lesson to be learned is that poison enters the body through inhalation, ingestion, or absorption, whereas venom is a toxin that gets injected into you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifK670q1kr52epLqwwdJmmKehnZa5brXNZquhnV2svLO4w2adq6edYsCvrcqeqmaZnpl6q7HLpbCfoaOderW7jKaYpqWRocBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-lee-jong-suks-parents-lee-jong-suk-biography-parents-name-nationality-and-more-556271-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who are Lee Jong Suks Parents?
