I loved what I saw (ha!), but the adults in the seats beside me did not, and while I drifted away from the series after the fourth, and over time adopted the more mature perspective, the trailer for SAW X has me reflecting on the merits of this franchise.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=567 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>To be clear, the SAW movies’ intense scenes of torture, and their production values reminiscent of a B movie — and a cheap one even by that industry’s standards — are nothing to envy. Then there’s the general meanness of each outing: few if any characters ever are given happy endings; people who have made comparatively tame mistakes driven to madness by a man who believes himself to be holier than thou in spite of his demonstrated evil; and too many talented actors (Cary Elwes being one) seem to be slumming for a paycheck I would regret later on.</p><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=107 data-injectable=false>However, behind the scenes, there are things in the overall structure any fan (or foe) should be proud of.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" id=h-practical-effects-in-an-era-of-lazy-cgi data-injectable=false>Practical effects in an era of lazy CGI</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/636445496735999858-XXX-SAW-MOV-12164-36555381.jpg><p data-characters=839 data-current-count=839 data-injectable=true>While other horror films, like Scream 4, use CGI for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shots</a> of knives going into flesh, the gore-nographic SAW franchise, which would likely get some creators put on a watchlist in a more repressive society, has always relied on tried and true practical effects for scenes like the above, with the reverse bear trap. An <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> in IGN shortly after SAW 3D came out features series production designer and SAW V director David Hackl revealing that the traps are built to function from day one of shooting, and are designed to be safe for the actors (though the water box from the fifth film involved some danger, as Scott Peterson had to be in it as it filled with water, without CGI) and, while a few digital touch-ups have since made their way into the franchise, you can see how the movie mutilations are still done with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prosthetics</a> here.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>A ridiculously impressive commitment to continuity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Saw-X-First-Look.jpg><p data-characters=936 data-current-count=1236 data-injectable=true>When you think of horror franchises, how many ever get through 10 films without a complete — or failed — attempt at a reboot? While the Scream franchise is getting close, Halloween has since been through more timelines than you can shake the limb of a murdered babysitter at, the ending of Friday the 13th: A New Beginning <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tried</a> to ditch Jason in favor of Tommy Jarvis, and A Nightmare on Elm Street sputtered into silence with a failed reboot in 2010. Somehow though, SAW keeps right on ticking. Star Tobin Bell has been dead since the third entry but keeps getting to come back in flashbacks — or prequels, in the case of SAW X — and stars like Elwes are somehow not shy about coming back. This casting continuity has drawn praise from outlets like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a> and, while still not the most highbrow genre, you have to ask yourself, what are the odds Kevin Bacon would ever return to Friday the 13th, or Adam Scott to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellraiser</a>?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>It takes on American healthcare when most franchises just want nameless and mindless victims with no cultural significance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Saw-Tobin-Bell.jpg><p data-characters=741 data-current-count=1041 data-injectable=true>Think back to the earliest film in this series. Do you remember who one of the victims was? Well, if not, allow me to refresh your memory, Elwes was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Lawrence Gordon</a>. He gave Bell’s John Kramer a bad diagnosis, which had progressed by the time of the second installment, and he became one of the first people in healthcare to be a target. The upcoming film follows this direction to a more literal extent, with Kramer dealing with a group of scammers who appear to be led by Americans and Europeans in Mexico. The sixth film trapped predatory lenders, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have</a> targeted the sick and desperate in America, and the third has a female doctor being forced to try and save John for free when he finally reaches the very end of his life.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Certainly, a bit more loaded, context-wise, hence more interesting than the horror franchises that victimize camp counselors or aroused teenagers. Whether the SAW franchise can take these interesting bits and expand such creativity to the rest of the franchise remains to be seen, and audiences will find out when SAW X (which is set between the first two) comes out this September.</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=false>Who knows, with a little luck, maybe this writer will be there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGxXam1pnnSmq5mnqKWu6S0yKycZpyVqLKzwsSsZKanopp6s7HSqZycrF2ptaK6jKKrZp%2BVqcBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./prepare-to-cry-in-poor-over-how-beautiful-emma-chamberlains-4-3-million-home-is.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Prepare to cry over how beautiful Emma Chamberlains $4.3 million home is</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./seascape-playwright-crossword-clue-la-times-answer-1119413.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Seascape playwright Crossword Clue LA Times Answer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-wash-nike-slides.html>How to wash nike slides</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rowan-atkinson-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88717-html.html>Rowan Atkinson Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./smutty-streaming-users-have-some-explaining-to-do-after-a-softcore-porno-unzips-a-new-lease-of-life.html>Smutty streaming users have some explaining to do after a softcore porno unzips a new lease of life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./6-films-prove-keanu-reeves-comedy.html>6 Films That Prove Keanu Reeves Should Do More Comedy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsey-lamb.html>Kelsey Lamb</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVibe.
